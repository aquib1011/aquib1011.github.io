Agricultural losses have an effect on the global economy,
and plant diseases are a primary cause of such losses. To address these
challenges, artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning can
help to leverage the consequences. Corn is one of the most significant
agricultural products. A disease outbreak might cause a significant drop
in corn production, resulting in millions of dollars in losses. The risk of
crop failure due to a disease pandemic can be mitigated with the help of
deep learning methods. Traditionally, plant illnesses are examined using
just oneâ€™s own eyes, with the emphasis typically being on color changes,
the presence of spots or rotten regions in the leaves, or both. Because
of their tiny nature, the symptoms of plant diseases might be difficult
for farmers to accurately detect in certain cases. In addition, many
people who operate farms are not specialists in the identification and
classification of diseases; thus, vision-based deep learning methods may be
able to aid farmers in delivering more accurate diagnoses, identification,
and classification. Convolutional neural networks have emerged as the
top choice for image processing over the last few years as advancements
have been made in related domains. Swin Transformer, which was
recently introduced, has shown significant improvement in classification
applications. We used the Swin Transformer to categorize maize leaf
diseases including blight, common rust, and grey leaf spot. Compared
to the state-of-the-art approaches currently available, our model has the
highest accuracy at 95.9%.
