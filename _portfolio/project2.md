Real-time semantic scene understanding is a challenging computer vision task for
autonomous vehicles. In the context of autonomous driving, the existing semantic
segmentation concept strongly supports on-road driving where hard inter-class bound-
aries are enforced and objects can be categorized based on their visible structures with
high confidence. Due to the well-structured nature of typical on-road scenes, current
road extraction processes are largely successful and most types of vehicles are able
to traverse through the area that is detected as road. However, the off-road driving
domain has many additional uncertainties such as uneven terrain structure, positive
and negative obstacles, hidden objects, etc. making it very unstructured. Traversing
through such unstructured area is constrained by a vehicleâ€™s type and its capabil-
ity. Most modern convolutional neural networks require large computing resources
that go beyond the capabilities of many robotic platforms. Image segmentation is a
key task in computer vision and image processing with important applications such
as scene understanding, robotic perception and video surveillance. This project will
serve as an extension of existing off-road semantic segmentation studies. The primary
emphasis of the thesis is on locating and visualising the route over off-road terrain
