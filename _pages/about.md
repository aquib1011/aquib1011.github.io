# About Me

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, focusing on Machine Learning and Computer Vision. 

## Experience
- **CrowdStrike, Boston, USA**
  - *Data Science Intern (Aug - Dec 2024)*
  
- **Data Core, Amherst, USA**
  - *Data Science Intern (Feb - May 2024)*
    - Developed a tattoo recognition model, optimizing and compressing long-duration video analysis to streamline processing efficiency. Labelled images using advanced tools such as LabelImg and CVAT, ensuring high-quality data annotation.
    - Utilized YOLOv8 for high-accuracy tattoo detection from extensive video footage. Integrated the powerful CLIP model to effectively cluster images based on detected tattoos with detailed meanings and context for each tattoo.

- **Binghamton University (SUNY), New York, USA**
  - *Summer Research Intern (Jan - May 2023)*
    - Investigated backdoor attacks in deep learning, achieving a 89% success rate in trojan attacks, highlighting the need for secure algorithms in Domain Adaptation.

- **Okayama University, Okayama, Japan**
  - *Research Intern (Aug - Dec 2022)*
    - Authored papers on using Swin Transformer for maize leaf disease classification (95.9% accuracy) and Vision Transformer for bearing defect classification (98.8% accuracy) using STFT.

- **University of Maryland, College Park, USA**
  - *Research Intern (May - Jul 2022)*
    - Engineered TeliNet 2.0 model for ECCV, analyzing 140GB of medical images; improved accuracy by 10%.
    - Achieved a top-quartile performance ranking in the competition by reducing computational resource requirements by 30%, showcasing exceptional skills in optimizing deep learning models for large-scale health data.

## Career Goals
