This workshop introduces the basics of Machine Learning which will help you understand the History of Artificial Intelligence, what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into self-learning mode without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use “pattern recognition” to produce reliable results. The latter part of the video discusses the main challenges in machine learning and How to frame and solve machine learning problems.[PPT](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFDmbJlgss/XRhWBzOEAiIghvl_PIhjQQ/view?utm_content=DAFDmbJlgss&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
