Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that uses computer vision algorithms to mimic how human vision acquires, processes, analyzes, and understands visual information. It can use this real-world visual data to collect predefined features and support decision-making with incredible speed and accuracy. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

Computer vision works much the same as human vision, except humans have a head start. The human sight has the advantage of lifetimes of context to train how to tell objects apart, how far away they are, whether they are moving, and whether something is wrong with an image.
In this workshop we have covered the basics of computer vision, Basic understanding of maths used in CNN's and Applications of CNN in real-world problem.
